## ❓ Q2:

## What is the difference between Hiding and Override?

### ✅ Comparison:

| Feature | Hiding (`new`) | Override |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| **Polymorphism** | ❌ Doesn't have | ✅ Has |
| **Virtual** | Not needed | Must be virtual |
| **Runtime** | Compile-time | Runtime |
| **Base Reference** | Base method is called | Derived method is called |

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">

```csharp
class Base {
    public void Method() { }  // Non-virtual
}

class Derived : Base {
    public new void Method() { }  // ✅ Hiding (Compile-time)
}

Base b = new Derived();
b.Method();  // Base.Method() is called ❌

// With Override:
class Base {
    public virtual void Method() { }
}

class Derived : Base {
    public override void Method() { }  // ✅ Override (Runtime)
}

Base b2 = new Derived();
b2.Method();  // Derived.Method() is called ✅
```

### 🎯 Note:

**Hiding** = Compile-time (based on reference type) | **Override** = Runtime (based on actual type)
