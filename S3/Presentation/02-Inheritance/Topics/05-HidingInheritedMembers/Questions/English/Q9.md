<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">

## ❓ Q9:

## How does Hiding Event work?

### ✅ Answer:

Events can also be hidden, but it's **very rare**.

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">

```csharp
class Base {
    public event EventHandler? Clicked;
}

class Derived : Base {
    public new event EventHandler? Clicked;  // ✅ Hiding event
}

Base b = new Derived();
b.Clicked += (s, e) => Console.WriteLine("Base");  // Base event

Derived d = new Derived();
d.Clicked += (s, e) => Console.WriteLine("Derived");  // Derived event
```

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">

### 🎯 Note:

Event Hiding is **very rare** and usually not needed. Use virtual events.
