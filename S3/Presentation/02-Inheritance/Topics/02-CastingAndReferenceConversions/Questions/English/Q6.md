## ❓ Q6:

## What is the difference between `as` and `is`?

### ✅ Comparison:

| Feature | `as` | `is` |
|-------|------|------|
| **Return Type** | Desired type or `null` | `bool` |
| **Exception** | Doesn't throw | Doesn't throw |
| **Pattern Matching** | No | Yes (C# 7+) |
| **Usage** | When we want to cast | When we want to check |

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">

```csharp
Animal animal = new Dog();

// With as:
Dog? dog = animal as Dog;
if (dog != null) {
    dog.Bark();
}

// With is (Pattern Matching):
if (animal is Dog d) {
    d.Bark();  // ✅ Shorter and more readable
}
```

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">

### 🎯 Note:

In C# 7+, `is` with pattern matching is **better** than `as` because it's shorter and safer.
