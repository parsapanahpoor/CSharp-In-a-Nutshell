<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">

## ❓ Q2:

## What is Upcasting?

### ✅ Answer:

**Upcasting** means converting from derived class to base class. This conversion is **implicit** and **always safe**.

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">

```csharp
class Animal { }
class Dog : Animal { }

Dog dog = new Dog();
Animal animal = dog;  // ✅ Upcast (Implicit - doesn't need cast)

// Why is it safe? Because every Dog is an Animal!
```

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">

### 🎯 Note:

Upcasting is done **automatically** and doesn't need `()`. It always succeeds.
