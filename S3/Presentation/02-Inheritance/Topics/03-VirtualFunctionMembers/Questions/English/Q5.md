## ❓ Q5:

## Why can't static methods be virtual?

### ✅ Answer:

Because **static methods** belong to the class, not to instance. Virtual methods are for **instance methods**.

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">

```csharp
class Animal {
    // ❌ Cannot do this:
    // public static virtual void Speak() { }
    
    // ✅ But we can have instance virtual:
    public virtual void Speak() { }
}
```

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">

### 🔍 Reason:

- **Static methods** are resolved at compile-time
- **Virtual methods** are resolved at runtime
- These two are **incompatible**!

### 🎯 Note:

Static methods don't have **Polymorphism**. They always execute from the class they're called from.
